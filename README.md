# Blue-Bank-loan-data-analysis
Blue Bank is a bank in USA that has a loan department which is currently understaffed.  
Through Python I did data pre processing so that this data can be further used in creating data visualization.
loandatacleaned.csv is the cleaned csv file which can be used for further data visualisation
